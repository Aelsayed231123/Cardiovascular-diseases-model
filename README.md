> Final Project

**Objective**

You are required to create a code from scratch that solves this problem
and make a suitable interface for it (AI & Software).

**Project** **Description**

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally,
responsible for approximately 17.9 million deaths each year, which
accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. The majority of CVD-related
deaths result from heart attacks and strokes, with a significant portion
occurring prematurely in individuals under the age of 70. This dataset
focuses on predicting heart disease, a common consequence of CVDs, using
11 key features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood
pressure, and cholesterol levels. Individuals at high cardiovascular
risk, due to factors like hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia,
require early detection and management. Machine learning models can
significantly aid in this process.

> a\. Preprocessing b. Model selection
>
> c\. Evaluation criteria
>
> d\. Explanation of your work
>
> e\. Comparison between approaches

**GuideLines**

> 1\. Understand the Data:
>
> a\. Try to conduct a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to
> understand the dataset.
>
> b\. Hint: Google "What is Exploratory Data Analysis" and explore
> Kaggle notebooks to discover useful functions and techniques for EDA.
>
> 2\. Choose Your Framework:
>
> a\. You are free to choose any machine learning or deep learning
> framework that you prefer for this project .
>
> 3\. Code Readability:
>
> a\. Ensure that your code is well-documented and includes comments for
> clarity.
>
> b\. The comments should explain the purpose of each significant block
> of code to make it understandable to others.
>
> 4\. Originality of Code:
>
> a\. Do not copy and paste code from any source. You must write
> original code and fully understand every line.
>
> b\. Important: Avoid using code auto-completion tools like GitHub
> Copilot. You will be required to explain your code during the project
> discussion.
>
> 5\. Dataset Usage:
>
> a\. Only use the datasetprovided for this project. **Using** **any**
> **other** **dataset** **will** **result** **in** **a** **zero**
> **grade.**
>
> 6\. Academic Integrity:
>
> **a.** **Any** **sign** **of** **cheating,** **plagiarism,** **or**
> **unauthorized** **collaboration** **will** **not** **be**
> **tolerated** **and** **will** **result** **in** **a** **zero**
> **grade** **for** **the** **project.**

**Deliverables**

> 1\. Your Code with results shown (You can either use notebooks or
